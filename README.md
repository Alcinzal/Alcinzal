# Alcinzal
That's me.

## Name
My name originates from these 3 terms:

| Term | Meaning |
| - | - |
| **Alci**des | This was the original name given to Heracles, the Greek hero and God of strength, known as the protector of mankind. |
| **N**umen | Numen is a Latin term that has multiple meanings, but can be generalized as "divinity". |
| **Zal** | Zal was a legendary Iranian king, and is recognized as one of the greatest warriors. |

Together they form **Alcinzal**. The meaning they hold together is for the individual to define.

Unfortunately, I don't yet embody the qualities of the terms mentioned, but perhaps one day I will.

I chose this artwork because I, like the figure within it, only exist digitally.
